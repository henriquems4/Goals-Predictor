# Football Team Prediction API

## Overview

This project is a Flask-based API designed to predict football match scores by focusing on goals rather than match outcomes. The main difference from traditional prediction models is that this API categorizes teams based on their performance in recent games, assigning them to tiers. It uses both Linear Regression and Poisson Regression to predict scores and evaluate the accuracy of these predictions.

The project is still in progress, and there is also a mobile application in a separate repository that interacts with this API.

## Features

- **Predict Goals:** Focuses on predicting the number of goals scored and conceded by each team, rather than just the match outcome.
- **Team Categorization:** Categorizes teams into tiers based on their recent performance.
- **Multiple Models:** Utilizes both Linear Regression and Poisson Regression for predictions.
- **Graphical Representation:** Generates graphs to visualize the regression results for each team.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Goals-Predictor.git
    cd Goals-Predictor
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up your secret API key in `config.py`:**
    ```python
    # utl.py
    API_KEY = 'your-key'
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Flask Application

1. **Start the Flask server:**
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    flask run
    ```
    The server will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### API Endpoints


## Predict Scores

### Function: `predict_scores(team_1, team_2)`

- **Parameters:**
    - `team_1`: List containing team 1's details `[name, tier, goals_scored, goals_suffered]`
    - `team_2`: List containing team 2's details `[name, tier, goals_scored, goals_suffered]`

- **Returns:**
    - Predicted scores for both teams using both Linear Regression and Poisson Regression models.
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both models.
    - File paths for the generated regression graphs.

## Mobile Application

A mobile application that utilizes this API is available in another repository. Please refer to the [Mobile App Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/football-prediction-mobile) for more details.
